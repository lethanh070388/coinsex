                  <p>Bitcoin trading and cryptanalytic currencies are susceptible to bubbles or loss of confidence, whether sensible or unreasonable, that may collapse. For example, trust in Bitcoin and cryptanalysts could collapse because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a legal change by the government, the birth of Other currency coding is better, or deflationary. Confidence can also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments can stop the transaction.</p>

                  <p>Thank you for using the COINSEX service for Bitcoin trading and cryptanalysts. Before you proceed, please pay attention to the following points:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A transaction on COINSEX is the exchange between the maker (the creator of the buying/ selling ad) and the taker (the user with the creation of the buy/sell ad). As such, taker will incur a fee of 0.7% of the transaction (the price shown is inclusive of the fee).</li>
                    <li>The price is determined by the maker by specifying the USD exchange rate against the local currency unit multiplied by Bitcoin rates and cryptanalysts or you can specify the lowest price you want to sell and the highest price you want. purchase, and there will be no interference from COINSEX. Therefore, the maker will bear full responsibility for its posted price, and we will not cancel the transaction that was paid for due to price errors and disagreement from taker. And COINSEX will also not provide the trader's information, the support team will reopen the trader's dispute (if possible) and allow the two parties to discuss the solution themselves. This dispute will be closed in 2 hours.</li>
                    <li> In COINSEX, we value honesty, fairness and respect. Any evidence of scamming, performing spaming actions, using inappropriate words or attempting to exploit the error will be permanently blocked if no obvious reason is given. Clear and freeze all remaining balance. You are required to thoroughly deal with old transactions before you can use the service. Please consider your language in exchange for other members or support staff of COINSEX.</li>
                    <li>A user may only have one account during use and the other account will be permanently blocked. The act of deliberately creating multiple accounts from one person is not counted as referrals.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h6 class="mt-5 font-bold">TRADING POLICY SUPPORT</h6>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Transactions older than 2 weeks (from the time the transaction was created to the present) are not checked from the technical department.</li>
                    <li>Bitcoins and cryptanalysts are irreversible transactions (can not be reversed if you have the wrong address), so you need to check your payment information carefully before completing your order. You can open a dispute on proof of payment from the buyer. COINSEX is always doing its best to protect the interests of its customers, but it is your responsibility first and most so be very careful and smart. COINSEX is obliged to pay the Bitcoin wallet and the cryptographic passwords that the buyer offers after the transaction is successful, and all Bitcoin and cryptographic transactions are public on the Bitcoin system node and Global cryptanalysts, for example Blockchain (You can check your wallet on Blockchain here). In case your wallet account has not been credited, you will need to wait for some confirmation (depending on the wallet provider, usually three), you can ask the vendor to check the Bitcoin switch and Your password types if the number of validations meets their requirements, and we do not take any responsibility for the case your wallet provider is not credited to your account.</li>

COINSEX support will intervene without feedback from the opposing party after the allowable time of the transaction.</li>

                  <p>If the seller does not send Bitcoin and the cryptographic money under the instructions for the transaction to move from the awaiting state to the unpaid, or if the buyer does not send the payment in the payment window (default is 15 minutes) The transaction will be canceled automatically.</p>
                  <p>If a buyer opens a dispute for a transaction, the buyer is required to provide a paid invoice, and the seller must check and verify the payment as soon as possible. COINSEX support will call twice to remind the seller (in case the seller provides a verification number). After 12 hours, without any response from the seller, we will complete the transaction and send the Bitcoin and other cryptanalysts to the buyer.</p>
                  <p>If a seller opens a dispute for a transaction, the buyer is required to provide a paid invoice. The maximum allowable time for new buyers (users who have less than 5 successful transactions on COINSEX) is 1 hour, and the other buyers are 6 hours. If there is no response during this time, the transaction will be canceled and Bitcoin and other crypto currencies will be returned to the merchant's available wallet.</p>

                  <p>Once the transaction is completed by the seller, the transaction can not be disputed, reversed or changed.</p>
                  <p>Providing fake information or material in a dispute or making false statements or attempting to enforce a certain outcome of a disputed transaction is considered a violation of this agreement.</p>
