Therefore, the maker will bear full responsibility for its posted price, and we will not cancel the transaction that was paid for due to price errors and disagreement from taker. And COINSEX will also not provide the trader's information, the support team will reopen the trader's dispute (if possible) and allow the two parties to discuss the solution themselves. This dispute will be closed in 2 hours.
